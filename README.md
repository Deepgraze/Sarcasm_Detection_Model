# Sarcasm_Detection_Model
This repository contains a sarcasm detection model built using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text samples and aims to classify whether a given sentence is sarcastic or not.

Features
✅ BiLSTM Architecture – Captures contextual dependencies in both forward and backward directions.
✅ Word Embeddings – Uses pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec) for better word representation.
✅ Attention Mechanism (Optional) – Enhances the focus on important words in a sentence.
✅ Preprocessing Pipeline – Includes tokenization, padding, and text cleaning.
✅ Training & Evaluation – Provides scripts for training, validation, and performance analysis using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy, Pandas
